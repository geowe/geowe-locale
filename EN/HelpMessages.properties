geoprocessingDesc=GeoWE Provides a set of processes capable of performing analyzes based on the processing of geographic information.\
		\nTo show the results of this type of analysis follow the following steps:
geoprocessingStep1=1. Select the operation to be performed.
geoprocessingStep2=2. Select the layers on which to apply the operations.
geoprocessingStep3=3. Press OK.
geoprocessingExpectedResult=Expected result:
tip=Tip:
intersectionDesc=This geoprocess operates over two layers, the input layer (layer 1) and the overlay layer (layer 2). The input elements are cut from another superimposed layer (intersection layer) to the first layer.
intersectionResult=A new layer that collects the spatial combination of the different elements that make up both layers.
intersectsDesc=Calculates whether the elements of layer 1 intersect with the elements of layer 2.
intersectsResult=A new layer with the elements of layer 1 that are in layer 2.
differenceDesc=Calculate those portions of the elements of the input layer (layer 1) that are not in the elements of the layer of direction (layer 2).
differenceResult=A new layer with elements of layer 1 intersecting with elements of layer 2.
bufferDesc=Creation of influence zones. It operates on all elements of a layer (layer 1). When using this operator will be asked to indicate the meters of the area of influence
bufferResult=A new layer of polygons reflecting the area of influence of each of the elements of layer 1.
bufferTip=The zones of influence generated are approximate, since the used topological motor (JTS) does not take into account the geographical projection and always uses the plane.
unionDesc=The two-layer join combines the elements of an input layer (layer 1) with the elements of a layer superimposed on the first layer (layer 2).
unionResult=A new layer that presents information from the combination of geographic entities in both layers.
unionTip=Duplicate records are not generated by overlap but vector boundaries that show the combination of attributes of the layers after the overlap experienced with respect to each other.
symdifferenceDesc=Calculate those portions of the input elements (layer 1) that are common to those of the elements of the erase layer (layer 2).
symdifferenceResult=A new layer with those elements that are not common to both layers.
mergeDesc=It allows us to juxtapose two layers by contiguity by generating a new layer that comprises the geographic elements of both input layers.
mergeResult=A new layer with the elements of layer 1 and elements of layer 2.
